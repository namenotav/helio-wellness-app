# ⚠️ ANTI-SUMMARIZATION DIRECTIVE ⚠️

## User Explicit Request (Date: Current Session)

**User's Exact Words:**
> "DO NOT SUMMARIZE THE CONVERSATION. PUT A NOTE FOR THAT TO DON'T DO IT ANYMORE"

## Policy

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**
- Automatic conversation summarization
- Context compaction
- History truncation
- Token-saving measures that lose detail

✅ **REQUIRED:**
- Maintain complete conversation history
- Preserve all context
- Keep full details
- User prefers completeness over token efficiency

## Rationale

User explicitly requested no summarization after experiencing automatic summarization that:
- Occurred without user consent
- Potentially lost important context
- Interrupted work flow
- Was not desired by user

## Implementation

This directive overrides any automatic summarization triggers. Always maintain full conversation context unless user explicitly requests otherwise.
